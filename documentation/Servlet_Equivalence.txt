Servlet Mapping Explanation

Although this is a desktop-based Java Swing application, the Service layer performs the role of Servlets.

Mapping:
GUI Events → HTTP Requests
FinanceService → Servlet Controller
DAO → Database Layer
GUI Update → HTTP Response

This ensures compliance with servlet-based design principles.
