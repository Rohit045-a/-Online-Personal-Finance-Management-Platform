# Online Personal Finance Management Platform 💰📊  

A Java GUI-based application that helps users **track expenses**, **set budgets**, and **receive personalized financial advice**, while enabling **admins** and **financial advisors** to manage the system efficiently.

This project is designed to align with the **Java GUI-Based Projects Marking Rubric – Review 1** and showcases:  
- OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces, Exception Handling)  
- Collections & Generics  
- Multithreading & Synchronization  
- Database Operation Classes  
- JDBC-based Database Connectivity

## 🎯 Project Overview

The **Online Personal Finance Management Platform** provides three main user roles:

1. **Admin**
   - Manages users and roles (Admin, Financial Advisor, User)
   - Configures system-wide settings
   - Manages financial data security settings
2. **Financial Advisor**
   - Provides personalized financial advice based on user data
   - Interacts with users via messages & feedback
   - Tracks user progress and generates reports
3. **User**
   - Tracks daily/monthly expenses
   - Sets and manages category-wise budgets
   - Receives personalized financial advice

The application uses a **Java GUI (Swing/JavaFX)** on the front-end and **JDBC + relational database (e.g., MySQL)** in the backend.

## 🧱 Technology Stack

- **Language:** Java (OOP-based)
- **GUI:** Java Swing / JavaFX
- **Database:** MySQL (or any relational DB)
- **Connectivity:** JDBC
- **Build Tool:** Maven / Gradle (optional)
- **IDE:** VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse

---

## 🧩 OOP Design 

The project uses core OOP concepts extensively:

- **Classes & Inheritance**
  - `User` (base class)  
    - `Admin` extends `User`  
    - `FinancialAdvisor` extends `User`  
    - `RegularUser` extends `User`  
- **Polymorphism**
  - Common methods like `login()`, `viewDashboard()` are overridden in subclasses.
  - `FinancialAdviceService` uses polymorphism to handle different advice strategies.
- **Interfaces**
  - `ReportGenerator` (for generating financial reports)
  - `SecurityConfigurable` (for security-related config classes)
  - `DatabaseOperations<T>` (generic interface for CRUD operations)
- **Exception Handling**
  - Custom exceptions:
    - `InvalidBudgetException`
    - `InsufficientDataException`
    - `DatabaseConnectionException`
  - Try-catch-finally and user-friendly error dialogs in GUI.

---

## 📚 Collections & Generics 

The project uses Java Collections and Generics in multiple layers:

- `List<Expense>` to store user expenses
- `Map<String, Budget>` to manage category-wise budgets
- `Map<User, List<Advice>>` to maintain advice history
- Generic DAO interface: `interface GenericDao<T>` with methods like:
  - `void save(T entity)`
  - `T findById(int id)`
  - `List<T> findAll()`
- Collections are used to:
  - Build financial reports
  - Calculate statistics
  - Generate graphs and summaries

---

## ⏱ Multithreading & Synchronization 

Multithreading is used for:

- Background loading of:
  - Expense data
  - Reports and charts
- Async tasks:
  - Generating financial advice
  - Exporting reports

Example usage:
- A dedicated `ReportGeneratorThread` class for generating reports without freezing the GUI.
- `synchronized` blocks/methods used when:
  - Writing to log files
  - Updating shared collections of `Expense` & `Advice` in multi-thread scenarios

---

## 🗃 Database Operations Classes 

Database logic is encapsulated in dedicated classes:

- `UserDao` – handles CRUD for `User`, `Admin`, `FinancialAdvisor`, `RegularUser`
- `ExpenseDao` – manages expense records
- `BudgetDao` – handles budget data
- `AdviceDao` – stores and retrieves financial advice & interactions
- `SystemSettingsDao` – manages system & security configurations

Each DAO:
- Implements a generic interface `GenericDao<T>`
- Uses prepared statements
- Returns domain model objects (e.g., `Expense`, `Budget`, `Advice`)

---

## 🔌 JDBC Database Connectivity 

**JDBC is used for:**

- Establishing connections via a dedicated class:  
  `DatabaseConnectionManager`
  - Manages:
    - DB URL
    - Username & Password
    - Connection pooling (optional)
- CRUD operations using:
  - `PreparedStatement`
  - `ResultSet`
- Proper resource management with:
  - `try-with-resources`
  - Connection closing in `finally` (if not using try-with-resources)

All database interaction is done through **JDBC** and not hard-coded data, fulfilling the rubric requirement.

- **Login Screen**
  - Role-based redirection (Admin / Advisor / User)
- **Admin Dashboard**
  - Tabs for User Management, Security, System Settings, Feedback
- **Advisor Dashboard**
  - Tabs for Advice Management, User Messages, Reports, Stats
- **User Dashboard**
  - Tabs for Expenses, Budgets, Advice, Reports, Profile
